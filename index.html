<h1>Duck-jump</h1>
<p>Kinda like Pacman, but with physics. You jump around collecting targets while avoiding enemies, and go for a high score.</p>
<!-- the <div> wrapping this image centers it on the page. -->

</div>
<p>The goal of the game is to collect the most targets. You collect targets by jumping into them and then landing on the ground. You lose when one of the
enemies reaches you. The enemies slowly track towards you, with a new enemy spawning after every 10 targets collected. Faster enemies spawn later in the game.
New targets spawn randomly when old ones are collected.</p>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p>The game is controlled with the arrow keys to aim the direction of jump, and the spacebar to initiate the jump. Holding the space bar allows for a higher jump.
A white line shows your direction, and a red line appears as you hold down the space bar and grows in size, determining how fast you will fly. Once liftoff is reached, you will fly in a parabola,
letting gravity take you back down and collecting any targets along the way, gathering points. Once you reach the ground, more targets will spawn, some new enemies may spawn, and you will be able
to line up a new jump. You can also bounce off the side walls and the ceiling if the power is really high.
<br><br>
Touching an enemy at any point (either in the air or waiting too long to initiate a jump) causes a game over, and prompts for a reset.</p>

<h2>Assets</h2>
<p>The assets are located <a href="https://kenney.nl/assets/shooting-gallery">here</a>. The main character is the duck, and the enemies are the geese. The white geese are faster. The targets are the collectables.
The score font can be used to display score, and the grass/trees can be used to spruce up the background. </p>
